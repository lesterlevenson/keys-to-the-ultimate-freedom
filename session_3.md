#### SESSION 3
## SPIRITUAL GROWTH

IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE BELOW APHORISMS BE ABSORBED ONE AT A TIME. TRY UNDERSTANDING ONE BEFORE GOING ON TO THE NEXT.

***
The whole object on the path is to let go of the ego. What remains is your Self.

***
The only growth there is, is the eliminating of the ego.

***
Ego is the sense of “I am an individual separate from the All.” In the extreme, it is egotism.

***
Growth is transcending yourself, your habitual self,
which is none other than ego.

***
Growth is the ego getting out of its misery.

***
Recognize that all joy is nothing but your Self, more or less.

***
There is no happiness except that of experiencing your Self. When you see that, it makes the path very direct. You stop chasing the rainbow and you go for the happiness where you know it is, right within you.

***
Everything you are seeking, you are, and very foolishly saying you are not. That's part of the enigma: everything everyone is seeking with such intensity, one has, and much more.

***
“It,” is you, when you say, “I,” that is the Infinite. Great big joke! Here you are infinite looking for your Self, which you are!

***
When anyone says he is not a master, he is lying.

***
Your effort should be for proper identity. Identify with
your Self!

***
Spiritual advancement is determined by how much you identify with your real Self.

***
The ego is very tricky. It often talks us out of this path for a short period of time, sometimes for a longer period of time. But once we've gotten into it, we usually almost always come back to it. So you have to be careful of the trickery of the ego-part of us. It can really take us away. No matter how far we have advanced on the path, the ego is always a treacherous companion that can take us off the path, and sometimes for an entire lifetime.

***
This is something we should be on guard against. The ego- sense latches on and says, “I am God. It latches onto the progress and it feels good and it says. “I am It” and by doing so it sabotages further growth.

***
When you recognize the opposition of the ego, you can let go of it. After practice it is easy and after you let go of enough ego, you just naturally feel the peace and joy of your Self.

***
It's actually a path of taking on more and more of your natural state of being infinite. You give up limitation. You give up misery. But you never give up anything worthwhile. You never give up anything good.

***
On this path you constantly give up trouble.

***
The first teacher is misery. It is usually the first thing that causes us to seek the way out.

***
First we start on the path to escape misery. Then we taste the Self and want It because It tastes so good.

***
On the path you never give up anything, you just take on more and more of what you really want until you have the All.

***
Take it for the sweetness that's in it, not to get out of the bitterness that's out of it.

***
We discover that we never give up anything on the spiritual path but our self-imposed bandages and miseries.

***
If you are weakly for the path, you are strongly for the sense-world.

***
You think you can't, that's why you can't.

***
It's only the thought “I can't do it,” that stops you from doing it.

***
Those who can’t, don't really want to.

***
Your growth depends only on you.

***
It will happen as fast as you can do it.

***
The only one who is going to change you, is you!

***
Wishing won't do it, nor will trying. You have got to do it!

***
Good intentions are no substitute for right action.

***
To change more rapidly, expect it!

***
You must have a very strong desire to change because you are such a victim of habit that you want the world as much as a drowning man wants air. To offset that, you must want to know your Self as much as a drowning man wants air.

***
Your success is determined by your desire for it. If you get discouraged, you are not really interested.

***
Your only real friend is you. Your only real enemy is you. You are an enemy to yourself to the degree you limit your Self. You are a friend to yourself to the degree you de-limit yourself.

***
What you do to yourself, it being your own doing, only you can undo it. You did it. You must undo it.

***
This entire path is a do-it-yourself path.

***
Do what is available to you to do. Do your best.

***
Every experience is to bless you, not to hurt you. If you stay in accord with principle, you will come out higher!

***
Every place and every situation in life presents an opportunity for growth.

***
The best place to grow is right where you are. The best time is now.

***
Be thankful for the opportunities to grow.

***
The greatest of all tests are those at home, with your immediate family. Therefore, home is an excellent place to grow.

***
A lot of spiritual growth can be had by practicing the real selfless love on your mate and family.

***
It is a good opportunity to grow when people are saying things about you, opposing you. It gives you a chance to practice the real Love. It gives you a chance to practice the real Peace. Because they are making sounds with their mouths is no reason why you should feel bad about it. Opposition is a very healthy thing. It provokes and firms growth.

***
It is necessary to remember that everyone can be our teacher. If we react to praise or pleasantries, that is developing ego. If we're depressed on criticism, that is ego. When we are our Self, there is no reacting.

***
There isn't anything that happens that can't be used. There's no incident that cannot be used as a teacher.

***
Every minute of every day should be used to grow by.

***
If we assume that we are there and we are not, circumstances soon awaken us to the fact that we are not.

***
If you tell others of your high experiences, of your gains, because of their jealousy, they say, “Ah, who does she think she is?” And that works against you and tends to pull you down.

***
Anytime you brag about anything, you're inviting a test of it. So, I warn you, if you are growing into these things, when they start coming, unless you're so sure you know by experience you can't lose it, its better not to tell anyone.

***
Be proud of your spiritual accomplishments. Be happy with them. Be proud of them to yourself.

***
When you have false spiritual pride you invite a challenge of the thing that you are proud of.

***
It is necessary to do away with doubts.

***
It takes more than faith. It takes knowledge. You start with faith, but you must convert it to knowledge. You must test it out, and then you know it.

***
In order to really understand, we must experience the knowledge.

***
When you experience, it is no longer intellectual.

***
You can get understanding without being able to put it into words.

***
The only maturity there is, is spiritual understanding.

***
Stand ye out and be different and don't let the others trick you back into where you were. It's not easy. It takes fortitude.

***
We should try to go all the way.To us it is given to do that. We have the possibility of going all the way back home, right to the Absolute.

***
Expect infinity, no more. You cannot expect too much.

***
Toe the line to the very end. The more you toe the line the sooner the end.

***
Every gain is an eternal gain. Every step forward you make now is forever.

***
We climb a ladder and each time we get up to another rung we forget about the rungs below. Then, when we get to the top, we kick the ladder a way.

***
The proof of this subject is the result you get.

***
The more you grow the less you feel the need to grow.

***

The higher you go the less the incentive to go further.

***
You never learn anything by disproving; you learn only by proving.

***
Studying the illusion helps make it real. If you want to know the Truth, don't study the opposite.

***
The whole process of growth is letting go of thoughts. When our thoughts are totally eliminated, there is nothing left but the Self.

***
Don't try to complicate it; it's too simple.

***
We can only expand out of the ego. The Self is.

***
Growth is letting go of being what you are not.

***
Let go of your ego, and be your Self!

***
As you grow, the whole world opens wide for you, you experience so much more. However, even if you have this whole world, you've only got a dot. Take the whole cosmos!

***
Longing for liberation is the key. Once you get that you'll be carried all the way.

***
In our desire to attain liberation or realization we are helped to the degree that we help all others.

***
Grow to the point where your whole attention is off you and on others.

***
Why shouldn't we all be masters, all of us, here and now?

***
The moment we decide to be the Self,-really decide,-it is so!

***
The higher you go, the more non-difference comes. You accept the leaders of all religions alike.

***
Having peace under ideal conditions isn't indicative of spiritual growth, it is escape.

***
When people are not growing they are going in the opposite direction. You should thank those who oppose you because they give you an unusual opportunity for growth.

***
When we start concerning ourselves with what they are doing, we're turning away from what we are doing.

***
You need constant confirmation until you don’t need it anymore.

***
Perseverance is necessary.

***
Adversity is a prod to growth.

***
The more intense the crises in this world, the more we have an opportunity to grow.

***
It would be so fast if people would, with constant, intense effort ask: What am I?

***
When you get the answer to What am I?, then you have control over your body and mind.

***
If there is anything you don't like out there, there is a need to change yourself.

***
You may see fully who you are and not be able to maintain it. What happens is that, being the infinite Self, we can get a glimpse of the infinite, hold it for a while, and then suddenly feel as though we've lost it. The reason for that is that the mind has not been eliminated. The subconscious thoughts of limitation are submerged for the moment. You may go completely into your Self and let go of the mind temporarily. You haven't eliminated the mind, you just momentarily let go of it. So there you are, for the moment, totally the infinite Self. However, the mind that has been submerged, re- emerges and then the ego takes over and you just can't understand what happened to you, what brought you back into the heaviness of the world again. What is required is that we re-establish that state of the Self again and again until it becomes permanent. Each time we do it, we scorch more of the mind, until finally we have scorched the entire mind. Then we are permanently established in the Self. Then you sit back and the mind is out there and the body is out there and you are not the mind, you are not the body. As long as you know you are not the mind and the body, both of them can go on to their heart's content, and you know that they cannot touch you.
